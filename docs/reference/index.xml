      <description>Background Stacks are a central SweetOps abstraction layer that are used to instantiate components. They&amp;rsquo;re a set of YAML files that follow a standard schema to enable a fully declarative description of your various environments. This empowers you with the ability to separate your infrastructure&amp;rsquo;s environment configuration settings from the business logic behind it (provided via components).
SweetOps utilizes YAML configuration for stacks because it&amp;rsquo;s an easy to work with format that is nicely portable across multiple tools.</description>

In our opinion, it offers a better user experience over apps like LastPass as well as provides integration with Duo and Slack for real-time activity notifications.
Best Practices Here are some of our recommended practices for working with 1Password. If your organization choses an alternative password management solution, we recommend implementing compensating controls.</description>
