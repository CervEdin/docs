      <description>Intro In this how-to, we will help you get started using Geodesic to work with AWS resources by helping you set up and use Leapp to handle credentials and authentication. Leapp is an open-source tool that makes this easier.
Prerequisites SweetOps Know-how We expect you&amp;rsquo;ve gone through the tutorial on &amp;ldquo;Getting started with Geodesic&amp;rdquo; prior to this How-To since that contains some important understanding of what Geodesic is, how it works, and what it&amp;rsquo;s doing.</description>

      <title>Authenticate with AWS inside of Geodesic using `aws-vault` _(Deprecated)_</title>
      <link>https://cloudposse.github.io/docs/howto/geodesic/authenticate-with-aws-vault/</link>

      <guid>https://cloudposse.github.io/docs/howto/geodesic/authenticate-with-aws-vault/</guid>
      <description>Intro In this how-to, we&amp;rsquo;ll provide a step-by-step guide on how we used to recommend authenticating with AWS inside of Geodesic, using aws-vault. This remains for historical reference and for companies who have been using aws-vault for a while and want to train new users. Cloud Posse no longer recommends this workflow. See Authenticate with AWS using Leapp for the currently recommended procedure.
Prerequisites System Requirements You&amp;rsquo;ll need to have an AWS Account with the ability to create credentials and have Docker installed on your local machine.</description>
