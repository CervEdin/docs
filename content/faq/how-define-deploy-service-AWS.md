## Question

If a service depends on a new AWS resource, then how do we define & deploy it?

## Answer

Background: For example, would it be a new commit to the staging/prod TF repos, followed by a deploy with Atlantis, then a commit to the main app repos in which we start using the resource?

More or less. We've been consolidating most Terraform code in the infrastructure repos per account.

Thereâ€™s some value to being able to synchronize infrastructure commits with app commits.
We've recently completed a proof-of-concept (PoC), where we create a `terraform`/subfolder nestled with the application code. However, we think this leads to infrastructure sprawl that might make it more confusing to understand where things are located.
